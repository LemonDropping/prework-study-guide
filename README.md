study guide for bootcamp prework 

# <Prework-Study-Guide>

## Description

This project was made as a study guide for my upcoming bootcamp with Rice University. It has notes for HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git workflow. By creating this website I learned how to make the frame of my website using HTML, style it by using CSS, Use JavaScript for interactivity and I utilized the git workflow to merge branches and keep my project organized. 

## Usage

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
